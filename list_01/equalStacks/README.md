# Equal Stacks

## Problem Description

You have three stacks of cylinders where each cylinder has the same diameter but different heights. You can remove cylinders from the top of any stack to make all three stacks the same height. The goal is to find the maximum possible height at which all stacks can be equal.

### Input Format

The first line contains three integers, representing the number of cylinders in each stack.
The next three lines contain space-separated integers representing the heights of cylinders in each stack, from top to bottom.

### Output Format

A single integer representing the maximum possible height of all stacks when they are equalized.
Example
Input:

```
5 3 4
3 2 1 1 1
4 3 2
1 1 4 1
```

Output:

```
5
```
