# Covid Genome Analysis

## Problem Description

A key task in Computational Molecular Biology is finding repeated segments in genomes, as these repetitions can provide important insights into the genome. For instance, concatenated repeats may be associated with diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

In this task, you will read the Coronavirus genome in consecutive blocks of 6 nucleotides (the bases are identified by the letters A, T, C, and G). Each line of the genome file contains 60 characters, so each line will yield 10 blocks. For example, the first line of the file is:

```txt
ATTAAAGGTTTATACCTTCCCAGGTAACAAACCAACCAACTTTCGATCTCTTGTAGATCT
```

The first block is `ATTAAA`, the second is `GGTTTA`, and so on. (You may ignore the last line if it contains fewer than 60 characters)

Your objective is to count, for each 6-base block, how many times that block is found in the entire genome, when reading the genome in non-overlapping blocks of 6 characters starting from the beginning of each line. For example, the block `ATTAAA` occurs 25 times in the covid genome overall (if you search throughout the file), but if you count only blocks extracted in steps of 6 symbols from the beginning of each line, there are only 3 occurrences of `ATTAAA` in the entire genome. Your program must output this latter number.

To accomplish this, you should implement your own hash table to store the 6-base blocks and count their occurrences. You will also need to create a hash function that, given a 6-base block, produces an integer (a position in the hash table). For collision handling, you can use either external chaining (e.g., a linked list of strings) or open addressing (e.g., double hashing).

## Input

- A text file containing the complete genome sequence of the Coronavirus (NC_045512.2 from NCBI).  
  **Note:** Each line of the file (except possibly the last) has exactly 60 characters.

## Output

- A text file containing two columns:
  - The first column is the 6-base block.
  - The second column is the number of occurrences of that block (considering only non-overlapping blocks of 6 characters per line).
  
  This output file must be generated by your program.

## Additional Details

- You must implement your own hash table and hash function.
- You may use any string-to-int conversion approach for the hash function (e.g., the method suggested by Prof. Gustavo, the approach described at <https://www.ime.usp.br/~pf/algoritmos/aulas/hash.html>, or any alternative you prefer).
- Ensure that your hash table handles collisions appropriately.

**Obs:** I also provided a second input file with a different genome sequence as well as the output file for that genome.
